**Frozen Defense** is a tower defense game project developed as part of an intake project for [Breda University of Applied Sciences](https://www.buas.nl/). It was created entirely in C++, utilizing a template provided by [3Dgep.com](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-2-template/).

It was an intake project for the university. The objective was to develop a game entirely in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Project Status

This project is considered complete, and not supported anymore. It was part of university intake, which I passed successfully.
I was a complete beginner and learning OOP from a complete basics when I was developing this project.

> This project was undertaken during my early stages as a programmer, and my main objective was to learn new concepts rather than produce polished code. As a result, **<u>the quality of the code is lacking.</u>**

## Creadits

Credits to [3Dgep](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-2-template/) as the template for the developed game is taken from their website.
*They have a nice tutorial on the website how to use it and make something interesting.*
